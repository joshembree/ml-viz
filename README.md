# ml-viz
Machine learning visualization with Dash and Plotly.

## Setup

First, create a virtual environment with `python=3.8` and enter it. Then install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, create the synthetic data in `synth.csv` by running

```
python synth_data.py
```

## Run the dash app

Run the dash app with 

```
python app.py
```

This will provide a local host where the app can be viewed. It will be something like `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`
